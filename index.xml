      <description>larry bird is the most well-rounded player of all time
As a well-rounded player you have to be better than average on offense and defense. Larry Bird stats show that he was not the best at steals, Blocks, and overall defensive stats.But his stats are in the discussion with a couple of the best defenders who have played the game. His stas show that he was beter than most people in the NBA when defending and is not a push-over when guarding against the greats like Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson.</description>

      <description>I chose to do my project on Nebraskaâ€™s 2021 football season because it was remarkably unlucky and I was there first-hand. I saw what the team was going through and I was there every practice. Most people only saw the finished product of the team, I was apart of the reconstruction and the progression of the 2021 season. I saw the talent we had and the time we spent working to get better.</description>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
